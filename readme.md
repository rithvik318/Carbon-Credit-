## Overview
A Web3 platform enabling peer-to-peer trading of tokenized carbon credits with:
- **MetaMask wallet integration** for secure transactions
- **ERC-20/ERC-721 smart contracts** for credit tokenization and retirement
- **Immutable transaction records** on Ethereum testnets
- **Transparent audit trails** via blockchain explorers

> **Note**: While core functionalities are implemented, we encountered persistent issues with testnet deployment due to time constraints and technical hurdles in our learning process.
